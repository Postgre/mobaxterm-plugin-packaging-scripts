This project contains simple scripts that will download dependencies, source 
code, and binaries and use them to automatically build working plugins for use 
with MobaXterm.

* To use the included scripts you will need the development tools package from 
  http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/plugins.html to build packages.

* After that just run the following scripts from within MobaXterm to build the 
  corresponding plugins:
  *cgdb.sh
  *lua.sh
  *mercurial.sh -- This package needs my Python 2.7.x plugin package to work.
  *readline-devel.sh
  *zip.sh
